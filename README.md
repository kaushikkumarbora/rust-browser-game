# Bloat-Free Browser Game in Rust (rustc-only challenge)

*Don't blame me if this code breaks in 1 years*

The idea is to make as bloat-free game in Rust as possible (not using [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/), [wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen), etc.) using only `rustc` executable. This could be achived by using [`wasm32-unknown-unknown`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html#tier-2) target directly and developing in [embedded style](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/embedonomicon/smallest-no-std.html).

We still use a little bit of JavaScript to
- Load the WebAssembly module with the logic of the Game,
- Organize the Event Loop,
- Display the Frame generated by the Game in the DOM.

## Quick Start

It is assumed that you are using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for managing your local Rust installation.

1. Make sure you have `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed:

```console
$ rustup target install wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

2. Build the game

```console
$ make
```

3. Play the game

```console
$ iexplore index.html
```
